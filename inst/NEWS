Changelog for 'emmeans' package

0.99.9xxx
    NOTE: 'emmeans' is a continuation of the 'lsmeans' package. New developments
        will take place in 'emmeans', and 'lsmeans' will remain static
        and eventually will be retired.    
    This is a major overhaul of lsmeans* package with emphasis on "estimated 
        marginal means" rather than "least-squares means"
    The flagship functions are now emmeans(), emtrends(), emmip(), etc.
        But lsmeans(), lstrends(), etc. as well as pmmeans() etc. are
        mapped to their corresponding emxxxx() function.
    In addition, we are trying to avoid names that could get confused as
        S3 methods. So, ref.grid -> ref_grid, lsm.options -> emm_options, etc.
    Classes "ref.grid" and "lsmobj" are gone (but backward-supported).
        Both are replaced by class "emm". Existing ref.grid and lsmobj objects
        inherit from emm so will still be usable.
    I decided to revert back to "kenward-roger" as the default degrees-of-freedom
        method for lmerMod models.
    Documentation and NAMESPACE are now "ROxygenated"
    Additional 'pigs' dataset
    Dispatching of emmmeans methods is now top-down rather than convoluted
        intermingling of S3 methods
    Improved display of back-transformed contrasts when log or logit 
        transformation was used: We change any ' - 's in labels to ' / 's
        to emphasize that thnese results are ratios.
    Greatly overhauled help page for models. It is now a vignette, 
        with a quick reference chart linked to details, and is
        organized by similarities instead of packages.
    A large number of smaller interlinked vignettes replaces the one
        big one on using the package. Several vignettes are linked in the
        help pages (why didn't I learn how to do this years ago?)
    Graphics methods 'plot' and 'emmip' are now **ggplot2**-based.
        Old **lattice**-based functionality is still available too.
    Moved 'Suggests' pkgs to 'Enhances' when not needed for building/testing
